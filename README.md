# Hi there 👋

I'm **Fedir Pavlyshynets**, a Software Engineer with 6+ years of experience, based in Budapest, Hungary.  
My main tech stack: React, Next.js, TypeScript, Node.js, Express.js, Nest.js.

## 👨‍💻 About My Experience
Over the past 6+ years, I've built and scaled production-grade web applications across frontend, backend, and Web3 domains. Starting in EdTech and B2B platforms, I honed skills in real-time collaboration tools, CMS integrations (like Contentful), and performance optimizations—boosting load times, accessibility (WCAG/ARIA compliance), and conversions through A/B testing and CI/CD automation.

Diving into Web3, I've contributed to high-stakes blockchain projects: from custom Layer 1 chains handling 8M+ transactions and 200k+ daily activity at Gunzilla, to cross-chain bridges (Solana ↔ Ethereum), wallet integrations (MetaMask, WalletConnect, Phantom, Solflare), and token launches on Binance. At Vareger's TransaTron, I led MVP delivery for TRON infrastructure, cutting fees by 60% via smart abstractions.

I've thrived in remote, cross-functional teams—leading code reviews, mentoring juniors, enforcing standards, and driving decisions in Agile environments. Passionate about clean, maintainable code that delivers real impact, whether optimizing ticketing systems for 10% sales uplift or securing dApps against vulnerabilities.

## 🔭 Currently working on ...
- **TransaTron** at Vareger: A non-custodial infrastructure service for the TRON network that enables seamless transactions without holding TRX. I delivered the core MVP, designed scalable frontend architecture for high-throughput transactions, and built a reusable UI library adopted across products—achieving up to 60% fee reductions via USDT abstraction.
